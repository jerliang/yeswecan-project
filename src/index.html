    <div class="info">
      We believe that it's never to early to teach kids about safety. As the saying goes, it's better to be safe than sorry. <br> </br>
      According to the California Department of Conservation, our state has between two to three major earthquakes each year that destroys buildings. <br> </br>
      California is also known for its devastating wildfires and we don't want kids to get caught in the crossfire. <br> </br>
      We provide a resource hub of interactive games that will teach your children what to do in case of a disaster.
      They're educational and fun :)
